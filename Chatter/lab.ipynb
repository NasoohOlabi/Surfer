I've also never really identified with my tech stack, both because it changes a lot and because frankly the complexity of my work never seems to boil down to low level implementation expertise. There are almost never any serious design meetings where the main point of contention is anything that is on the layer of programming patterns or language details (but obviously yes to system design). The problems that I mainly solve seem to be more \"engineering\" than programming, and while I'd say they are complex, they seem to be mostly a function of general analytical reasoning and more system design-level understanding.Is this sort of position actually that common outside of tech companies? I'm asking mostly out of curiosity, but also while I was lucky to land in another tech company after getting laid off in January, if I get laid off again and don't have the same luck, I'm not sure if I should take steps to brand myself as something less generalist when exploring other options.51 commentsAwardsharesave22 people hereu/getsentryÂ·promotedPaste this line into your terminal to use Next.js with Sentry. sentry.ioIns` and your take on the topic in less that 20 words what would you send to him in chat ?\n"
