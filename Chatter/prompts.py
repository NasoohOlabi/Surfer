            I think both myself and a lot of my coworkers/friends fall under this category of "backend non web-dev stack agnostic generalist software engineer" that seem to hang out in product companies.While I've gotten experience in domains by virtue of the teams and projects I've worked with, I wouldn't really identify them as being my "specialty". I've also never really identified with my tech stack, both because it changes a lot and because frankly the complexity of my work never seems to boil down to low level implementation expertise. There are almost never any serious design meetings where the main point of contention is anything that is on the layer of programming patterns or language details (but obviously yes to system design). The problems that I mainly solve seem to be more "engineering" than programming, and while I'd say they are complex, they seem to be mostly a function of general analytical reasoning and more system design-level understanding.Is this sort of position actually that common outside of tech companies? I'm asking mostly out of curiosity, but also while I was lucky to land in another tech company after getting laid off in January, if I get laid off again and don't have the same luck, I'm not sure if I should take steps to brand myself as something less generalist when exploring other options.51 commentsAwardsharesave22 people hereu/getsentry·promotedPaste this line into your terminal to use Next.js with Sentry.

Exactly where I landed.2ReplyGive AwardShareReportSaveFollowlevel 1d0s4gw · 7 hr. agoAny given system is not supposed to have a high degree of technical complexity. The point of being a senior or staff engineer is to enable juniors and mid level engineers to deliver impact quickly with low risk. If the system is easy to extend and operate then that’s because the people that designed it did a good job.Your job is to quickly translate vague information into clear requirements into shipped code. No one cares which data structures was used when you recovered $50m a year in opex. Your resume should explain the value that you delivered. The tech stack is ancillary.33ReplyGive AwardShareReportSaveFollowlevel 2cjrun · 4 hr. agoProblem is, if you don’t have those buzzwords on your résumé, even the hiring manager won’t be interested.6ReplyGive AwardShareReportSaveFollowlevel 3d0s4gw · 3 hr. agoYea exactly.

You can end up not having 10 years of experience, but 1 year repeated 10 times.For the most part  my 'brand' as a self employed contractor who focusses on the Java ecosystem doesn't have much to do with Java itself, but more with the type of work I do. I focus on complex enterprise systems, often with a ton of different systems interacting, and providing my clients with deep expertise in how to not turn those into big balls of mud. If you're mostly doing the same simple back-end projects (like in wordpress as an extreme example) you don't get that experience.So I don't agree that what you're describing is 'good' or 'bad'. It really depends on how you plan and advance your career. For example as this generalist if you don't now have cloud-native experience you're IMHO falling behind the curve.28ReplyGive AwardShareReportSaveFollowlevel 1ir0nuckles · 6 hr. agoThere are almost never any serious design meetings where the main point of contention is anything that is on the layer of programming patterns or language details (but obviously yes to system design). The problems that I mainly solve seem to be more "engineering" than programming, and while I'd say they are complex, they seem to be mostly a function of general analytical reasoning and more system design-level understanding.I'm confused. Isn't this what being a software engineer is?I've never done "design reviews" of programming patterns. That's for a code review, or if needed, you can engage your team before you start a project to ensure you're following best practices.This post is really strange to me. If you're asking "how do I prepare my skillset for find a job outside of tech" then I would suggest you become really good cloud computing platforms and patterns. Almost every enterprise is using a cloud provider at this point. If you're the expert in AWS, GCP, or Azure, you're probably guaranteed to find some work somewhere in the world working with one of these platforms.4ReplyGive AwardShareReportSaveFollowlevel 1FlutterLovers · 10 hr. agoGeneralist will make you a better engineer, but focus will get you hired.

It’s the companies that insist on having experience in a very specific stack that tend to pay poorly in my experience. What am I missing?72ReplyGive AwardShareReportSaveFollowlevel 3Successful_Leg_707 · 8 hr. agoMy understanding is the specific tech stack companies tend to “hire when it hurts”.  They want someone already up to speed on a language and framework in demand.  They are less willing to gamble on long term potential.  You get a salary but no RSU to retain you.Tech agnostic companies hire for long term potential and projected growth.  Amazon for example will use a language like Java but develop their own in house framework, so knowledge in a specific framework like Spring is less useful.  The tech companies will have some sort of leetcode interview process that is an indicator for general cognitive ability and fundamental comp sci concepts.

The top startups also tend to hire the "general cognitive ability + fundamentals" way, despite having the same short timeline requirements, while some legacy companies that tend to have longer tenures hire the more specific way. It's possible it's more a function of a higher hiring bar tending to correlate with the agnostic approach, whichever way that causation goes.1ReplyGive AwardShareReportSaveFollowlevel 3Acidic-Soil · 8 hr. agolevel 2ExistentialDroid23 · 9 hr. agoI see those claims like "generalists are better engineers" but I don't see the connection. Wouldn't diving to one language/framework deep for 2-3 years give you a deeper understanding that you carry around easier later than fumbling 2-3 frameworks on the same timeframe?I guess what I dislike is the equivalency of "more languages = better engineer" when in fact what matters is the proper use of the tool, not necessarily how many tools you have.3ReplyGive AwardShareReportSaveFollowlevel 3slightly_offtopic · 9 hr. agoEach language/framework has a preference for a certain way of solving problems.
