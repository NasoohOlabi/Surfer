One morning I was there much earlier than my student so I was waiting, sipping my coffee.\n\nThere were two guys at the next table. They looked to be in their 20s? They looked fairly young. It was mostly one guy talking. He was telling his friend how he ended up on a date with this single mum somehow who was older than him, and that her kid came to the date which he was very annoyed about.\n\nAt the end though (think they went to a museum or something), he bought the kid an ice cream and the kid said he had the best day of his life and asked his mum if they could hang out again.\n\nThe guy was explaining how that filled him with, like, a sense of purpose... And even his boring job didn't seem so boring anymore after that.\n\nAnd then my student arrived and I had to stop eavesdropping lol.\n\nI dunno... This was a while ago but I think about this story a lot.\n\nEdit: Sorry, I made that so wordy at first.```\n\n`None`",
