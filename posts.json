I didn't know him very well, he kept to himself and there was no next of kin to clean out his belongings so the property owner asked if I would help. Of course I told them yes (alot of how i survive is trading favors and bartering instead of cash exchange). So today I was helping and the land owner asked me if I wanted beer that belonged to the late neighbor and I excepted it, putting me in a weird spot. What do you guys think is the proper way to show my respect? Pour one out for him? Open one in his honor? Have the local bruha help? Idk guys I'm at a loss rn open to suggestions.",
